# Indecisive Eater

## About
This is an app that consumes the Yelp API and randomizes the results. It's a standard React app, and is structured so that each component is in its own separate
file (as a way to familiarize myself with good engineering practices). You will find in `src/util` a file named __Randomizer.js__. This is what separates the project from being just a Yelp clone. It randomizes the response from the Yelp API so you get a different response each time. 

## Search Parameters
Since the Yelp API works without any parameters, this app will still work without putting in any parameters. Due to the nature of the UI, however, you will be forced to select a price point. For best use, only input price point and location, if you are someone like me who can't decide what to eat because they will eat just about anything.

## Additional Info

The project is hosted on https://stjohnlau711.github.io/IndecisiveEater/, feel free to download the repository and make it your own, and if anyone is nice enough to make a pull request to make __Randomizer.js__ cleaner, it would be greatly appreciated.
